# :trophy: Linear Regression/Multiple Linear Regression in R using AutoMPG dataset Project :trophy:


## About dataset

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes."

## Attribute Information

1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)

## My Goal 

In this project we will investigate the impact of a number of automobile engine factors on the vehicleâ€™s mpg. The dataset auto-mpg.csv contains information for 398 different automobile models. Information regarding the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and car name as well as mpg are contained in the file. 
Using multiple linear regression to determine the relationship between mpg and different combinations of independent variables
. 
Consider all possible combinations of independent variables. Here we will report all the appropriate information regarding regression. We have to investigate - 
1) Multiple R-squared 
2) Adjusted R-squared 
3) Complete Linear Regression equation
